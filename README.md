## Tech Used: 


## Client: EJS CSS


**EJS:**
#### Why was this stack chosen?
I used EJS for my view. I wanted a chance to use a new tool that looked kinda similar to html and javascript. EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 


## Server: Node, Express, RapidAPI

#### Why was this stack chosen?

Node is a pretty lightweight server choice and can be spun up fairly easily. I needed a backend that could send a different response based on the result of another controller. 

By using Express' built in middleware architecture we could cleanly write fallbacks. 

RapidAPI has a free tier that's easy to integrate.
